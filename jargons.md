## KISS

KISS stands for `Keep It Simple, Stupid!`. The KISS principle was coined by Kelly Johnson, and it states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than making them complex; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.


## YAGNI

YAGNI stands for `You Aren't Gonna Need It!`. YAGNI is a principle behind the extreme programming (XP) practice of "Do the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work”. Even when this principle is part of XP, it is applicable in all kind of methodologies and own processes of development.


## DRY

DRY

`Don’t Repeat Yourself` – How many times do you see that there are similar codes, in different parts of a system. Well, this principle is formulated by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.  In other words, you must try to maintain the behavior of a functionality of the system in a single piece of code.

In the other hand, when the DRY principle is violated it is called as WET solutions, which is stand for either Write Everything Twice or We Enjoy Typing.

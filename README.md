# How to Explain
Explaining programming concepts in laymen terms. 

## Apache Yarn
Apache Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a cluster management technology. YARN is one of the key features in the second-generation Hadoop 2 version of the Apache Software Foundation's open source distributed processing framework.

## Big Data
Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing application software is inadequate to deal with them

## Cap Theorem

In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide more than two out of three of the following guarantees: Consistency. Availability. Partition tolerance.

## Erlang
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents

## Elm
A functional language that compiles to JavaScript

## Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of big data sets using the MapReduce programming model.

## Kafka

Kafkaâ„¢ is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies.


## Machine Learning
Machine learning provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Race Condition
A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly

## Redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store.

- Usage: database, cache and message broker
- Data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries

## Replication

Copying an entire table or database onto multiple servers. Used for improving speed of access to reference records such as master data.

## Partitioning

Splitting up a large monolith database into multiple smaller database based on data cohesion. Example - splitting a large ERP database into smaller database like accounts database, sales database, material database etc.

## Clustering

Using multiple application servers to access the same datatabase. Used for computation intensive, parallelized, analytical applications that works on non-volatile data.

## Scala
Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions were designed to build from criticisms of Java

## Sharding

Splitting up a large table of data horizontally i.e.row-wise. A table containing 100s of millions of rows may be split into multiple tables containing 1 million rows each. Each of the tables resulting from the split will be placed into a separate database/server. Sharding is done to spread load and improve access speed. Facebook/Twitter tables fit into this category.

## Solidity

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).


## Concurrency

Concurrency is essentially when two tasks are being performed at the same time. This might mean that one is 'paused' for a short duration, while the other is being worked on. Importantly, a different task is begun before an ongoing task is completed. This makes it a multi-programming model.

## Parallelism

Parallelism requires that at least two processes/tasks are actively being performed at a particular moment in time. As illustrated by the metaphor above, this means that you require at least two 'processors' or 'workers'.

## Dummy 

(Related to testing) An object that does nothing except fill in space. Any calls that it receives will neither change anything nor record anything.

## Stub

(Related to testing) An object that can consume test behavior and generate some result. It is meant to provide precreated answers for the test. Stubs can be used for recording and analysis to determine the number of calls that are made. They typically require more work than dummies, and an abundance of classes need to be created.

## Fake 
(Related to testing) A fake object is a real object that overrides the more difficult stuff by providing a shortcut.

## Mock 
(Related to testing) An object that is given orders to carry out a prescribed set of commands when it is called upon. This is analogous to the stand-in opponent during preparation for a political debate. The opponent would likely be a compaign team member, but she would have a set of answers already prepared to debate the candidate who needs to train for the big event.
